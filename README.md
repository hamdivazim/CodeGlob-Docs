## What is this?
- You can help contribute to the CodeGlob Docs! The docs are currently in development and you can start contributing even as early as now!

## How to Contribute

## What to Contribute
If you think there is a gap in the docs that needs to be filled, then by all means you can open a pull request with the new page added! If you think there is wrong information or a typo, you can edit that too! Make sure to not edit anyone else's work unneccesarily.
